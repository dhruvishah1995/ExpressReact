# 🚀 ExpressReact

Welcome to **ExpressReact**! This project is a full-stack application built with **Express.js** and **React.js**. It was initially developed during my time at a previous employer. While the codebase served its purpose, certain technical decisions were not optimal due to various constraints. I am currently working to **refactor and improve the application**, focusing on efficiency, maintainability, and performance.

---

## 💡 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- **Enhance code quality** by refactoring existing components and modules.
- **Improve efficiency** in both the backend and frontend workflows.
- Address **technical debt** and make the application more maintainable.
- Implement **modern best practices** in full-stack development.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Express.js**: Handles the server-side logic and APIs.
- **Node.js**: Provides the runtime environment for the backend.

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Manages the user interface and client-side interactivity.
- **Redux**: For state management (in progress).

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary database used for data persistence.

### Tools
- **Docker**: For containerized deployments (planned).
- **Postman**: For API testing.
- **Git**: Version control for managing changes.

## 🌟 Current Progress

### Improvements Underway
- Refactoring the backend to improve **API performance and maintainability**.
- Modernizing the frontend by converting class-based components to **functional components** with hooks.
- Implementing a consistent **error-handling mechanism**.

## 🤔 Challenges and Learnings

### Challenges
- The codebase had a lack of structure and clear design patterns.
- Initial decisions were rushed due to tight deadlines.

### Learnings
- The importance of well-documented code and modular architecture.
- How to handle refactoring a live project while ensuring minimal disruption to users.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployment pipelines.
2. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**: Optimize frontend performance.
3. **Improved Logging and Monitoring**: Add tools for better debugging and issue resolution.
4. **Responsive UI Overhaul**: Modernize the user interface for all devices.
5. **Test Integration**: - Add Unit tests and Integration tests for better reliability.
